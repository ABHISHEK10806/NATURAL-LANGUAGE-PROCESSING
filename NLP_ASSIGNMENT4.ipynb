Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made.

Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can't save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite.<br /><br />I would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you'll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.\",\n          \"I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college.

There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton.

They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 8) Tokenization"],"metadata":{"id":"Mv378QjjpHfE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tokens = word_tokenize(text)\n","print(\"\\nTokens:\\n\", tokens[:20])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"_h-9qE31o8rB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767020755940,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":50,"user":{"displayName":"ABHISHEK","userId":"10144540838703416989"}},"outputId":"b07a38c3-55be-4646-e667-a49768653435"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Tokens:\n"," ['One', 'of', 'the', 'other', 'reviewers', 'has', 'mentioned', 'that', 'after', 'watching', 'just', '1', 'Oz', 'episode', 'you', \"'ll\", 'be', 'hooked', '.', 'They']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 9) Stopword Removal"],"metadata":{"id":"gKfo_23LpRFa"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n","\n","filtered_tokens = [\n","    word for word in tokens\n","    if word.lower() not in stop_words and word.isalpha()\n","]\n","\n","print(\"\\nAfter Stopword Removal:\\n\", filtered_tokens[:20])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-tBJNGjIpQd-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767020789635,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"ABHISHEK","userId":"10144540838703416989"}},"outputId":"788b283b-58e7-45c1-bf5c-c89d71cf9e24"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","After Stopword Removal:\n"," ['One', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'watching', 'Oz', 'episode', 'hooked', 'right', 'exactly', 'happened', 'br', 'br', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'Oz', 'brutality', 'unflinching', 'scenes', 'violence']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 10) Stemming"],"metadata":{"id":"Pd3xpPUkpZ90"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["stemmer = PorterStemmer()\n","\n","stemmed_words = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in filtered_tokens]\n","\n","print(\"\\nAfter Stemming:\\n\", stemmed_words[:20])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"3SPUuWo8pPol","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767020815597,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"ABHISHEK","userId":"10144540838703416989"}},"outputId":"529435a1-0673-4e81-9fdb-a11e403923b8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","After Stemming:\n"," ['one', 'review', 'mention', 'watch', 'oz', 'episod', 'hook', 'right', 'exactli', 'happen', 'br', 'br', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'oz', 'brutal', 'unflinch', 'scene', 'violenc']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 11) Lemmatization"],"metadata":{"id":"n9B421p0pqbZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n","\n","lemmatized_words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in filtered_tokens]\n","\n","print(\"\\nAfter Lemmatization:\\n\", lemmatized_words[:20])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"xK-KQOa0peMJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767020894128,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4144,"user":{"displayName":"ABHISHEK","userId":"10144540838703416989"}},"outputId":"6be912ea-2ae3-4bfe-cf19-952605d476b2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","After Lemmatization:\n"," ['One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'watching', 'Oz', 'episode', 'hooked', 'right', 'exactly', 'happened', 'br', 'br', 'first', 'thing', 'struck', 'Oz', 'brutality', 'unflinching', 'scene', 'violence']\n"]}]}]}
